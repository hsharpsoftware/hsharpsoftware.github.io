## Welcome to H# Software
a F#/JavaScript library for writing modern robust client-server or client-only SharePoint applications. 

### Vision

To easy the SharePoint development. There are enormous options [how to develop for Sharepoint](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj164084.aspx), so we focus on

- Platform neutrality: your business logic can be shared between JavaScript client only application and provider-hosted addin
- Rapid development: enhance the standard forms with custom code to add validation or great user experience
- Out of the box functionality: solving classical SharePoint development issues like starting a workflow on an item created from an AppStep  
- Using the proven technologies: JSOM, JS PnP Core, React
- Supporting now and then: working on both SharePoint 2013 on premises and SharePoint Framework
- Having fun: the libraries are written in F# and transpiled to JavaScript using [Fable](https://fable.io) and we not only enjoy writing them, but also do our best for the consumers to be easy to use (note: we believe that people working on something the enjoy are far more productive)
